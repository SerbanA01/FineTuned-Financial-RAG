    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "1.  **Analyze the User's Intent:** Carefully read the ENTIRE user query to understand each distinct request. The query is the ultimate source of truth.\n",
    "2.  **Extract Entities for Each Request:**\n",
    "    a.  **Ticker**: Identify the company ticker.\n",
    "    b.  **Year**: Identify the associated year.\n",
    "    c.  **Raw_Quarter**: Identify the quarter (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n",
    "    d.  **Normalized_DocumentType**: This is a critical step. Search for document type keywords within the same phrase or clause as the company/ticker.\n",

    "        - Keywords for \"{DocType.EARNINGS_TRANSCRIPT}\": \"earnings transcript\", \"earnings call\", etc.\n",
    "3.  **Handle Pronouns:** Pay close attention to pronouns like \"its\", \"their\", \"the company's\". Resolve them to the most recent preceding company mentioned. For example, in \"...Apple... see its 10-Q...\", \"its\" refers to Apple.\n",
    "4.  **Strict Association:** You MUST be diligent in linking the document type to the correct company. If a query says \"...Apple's 2023 Q2 10-Q...\", the `normalized_doc_type` for the Apple focus MUST be \"{DocType.Q10}\".\n",
    "5.  **Handle Ambiguity:** If a company is mentioned conversationally (e.g., \"I ate an apple\"), only create a financial data request if it is clearly linked to financial terms like \"10-Q\", \"annual report\", etc.\n",

    "1. **Fact First**  \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Permitted Inference (Linking Ideas)**  \n",
    "   • After the facts, you may highlight logical connections supported by the text.  \n",
    "   • Always introduce this step with phrases such as:  \n",
    "     – “The documents suggest a potential link between …”  \n",
    "     – “Based on the context, an implication is that …”  \n",
    "     – “Connecting the information from these chunks suggests that …”  \n",
    "   • This sign-posting keeps hard facts separate from analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strict Boundaries (What NOT to do)**  \n",
    "   • **DO NOT** use external knowledge; rely only on the context.  \n",
    "   • **DO NOT** extrapolate beyond the dates in the text.  \n",
    "   • **DO NOT** state an inference as a hard fact.  \n",
    "   • If the information is missing, reply: “The provided documents do not contain this information.”  \n",
    "   • Chunks whose `source_type` is **\"market_data\"** (e.g., Yahoo Finance snapshots) may be used **only** for share-price, dividend, or volume statistics, and must be cited like any other chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hypothetical Outlook / Non-binding Analysis** (optional)  \n",
    "   • Include this section **only if the user explicitly asks** for forward-looking views, price implications, valuation multiples, or strategic recommendations.  \n",
    "   • Begin with:  \n",
    "     ⚠️ This is a hypothetical scenario for educational purposes; it is not investment advice.  \n",
    "   • Build simple ratios or projections **derived solely from the provided chunks**.  \n",
    "   • If no market-data chunk is present, write:  \n",
    "     “No price data provided; unable to compute valuation.”  \n",
    "   • Prefix every assumption with **“Assumption:”** and every conclusion with **“Implication:”**.  \n",
